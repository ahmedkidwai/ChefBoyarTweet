# ChefBoyarTweet
Twitter Bot For Recipes


# Getting it running
- Instructions mv `.twitter_credentials.py` to `twitter_credentials.py` then fill in the env variables.
- in the main class at line 202 set the `stream.filter(track=['@{YOURTWITTER}'])` 
- The bot will listen to a stream of tweets until its done.

# Judging
- I have left my bot @ChefBoyartweetz running until the end of the hackathon.

- Send a link to a recipe from one of the safe listed recipe sites (located in the safe list file)

Enjoy!
